emerged in the U.S., they tended to originate among either men who had sex with
other men, hemophiliacs, and heroin users. The prevalence of the disease among gay
men in the U.S. in the 80s and 90s initially resulted in a stigma against homosexuals
and a general fear and misunderstanding regarding how AIDS was spread. However,
as celebrities like Rock Hudson and Freddie Mercury revealed that they had the
